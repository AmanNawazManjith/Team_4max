# COVID Diagnosis and Analysis
COVID-19 had has an enomormous impact on lifestyle of poople in the last 2 years. Nonprofits, universities and other academic institutions around the world are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics to help us better understand COVID-19 and its impact on communitiesâ€”especially vulnerable populations and healthcare workers.

We made a Web Application with the help of the Streamlit API, in the Web Application we will be conducting both a diagnosis using a machine learning modelon the first page of the web application and then on the 2nd page we will show Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the covid cases data to see the variations of confirmed cases, cured cases, deaths over time as well as density of cases in various states in India and represented them graphically on scatter plots, line graph and bar graph for convenience.

We have also implemented a trained classification model to predict if a person has covid or not from a set of his/her symptoms.The interface in created in streamlit.
